# Data Model: User & Organization Management Module

**Feature**: `006-users-organizations-module`  
**Date**: 2026-04-14  
**Firestore Root**: `audits/` (system-level), `organizations/{orgId}/memberships/`, `organizations/{orgId}/roles/`, `organizations/{orgId}/policies/`, `organizations/{orgId}/audits/` (org-scoped), `deletionTasks/`

## Audit Architecture

This SaaS platform provides API services (Authentication, Memory, Store, Context, Dashboard) to organizations via API keys. Auditing is split into two tiers:

| Tier | Collection | Scope | orgId | Who can read |
|------|-----------|-------|-------|--------------|
| **System** | `/audits/{auditId}` | Platform-wide: user auth (login/logout), API key events, org lifecycle, rate limits. Many events have **no orgId** (e.g., login attempts before org context is known). | `null` or set | Platform super-admins only |
| **Org-scoped** | `/organizations/{orgId}/audits/{auditId}` | Always org-bound: user management, role/policy changes, resource CRUD within the tenant. `orgId` is always set. | always set | Org admins (based on RBAC permission `audit:read`) |

Both collections are append-only and immutable.

---

## RBAC/ABAC Architecture

Each organization (tenant) has fine-grained access control via two building blocks:

| Concept | Collection | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Role** | `organizations/{orgId}/roles/{roleId}` | Named set of permissions (e.g., `store-editor`, `context-viewer`). Built-in system roles: `owner`, `admin`, `member`. Custom roles defined per org. |
| **Policy** | `organizations/{orgId}/policies/{policyId}` | ABAC rules that conditionally grant/deny permissions based on resource attributes (e.g., allow `store:write` only on stores tagged `environment=staging`). |

**How evaluation works (order of precedence)**:
1. Check if user is org `owner` → full access.
2. Evaluate ABAC `policies` matching the resource attributes → explicit deny overrides any allow.
3. Evaluate RBAC `roles` assigned to the user → collect effective permissions.
4. If permission not found → deny by default.

**Permission naming convention**: `{service}:{action}` where service is one of `auth | memory | store | context | files | users | api-keys | billing | audit` and action is one of `read | write | delete | manage`.  
Examples: `store:read`, `memory:write`, `users:manage`, `audit:read`.

## Firestore Collections

### `/organizations/{orgId}/memberships/{userId}`

Subcollection on each organization. Tracks all user memberships, including role and deletion status.

| Field       | Type                | Required | Notes                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`        | `string`            | ✅       | Firebase Auth UID (same as document ID)                                        |
| `orgId`       | `string`              | ✅       | Denormalized parent org ID (enables `collectionGroup` queries)                                |
| `userId`      | `string`              | ✅       | Reference to `/profiles/{userId}`                                                            |
| `baseRole`    | `"owner" \| "admin" \| "member"` | ✅ | Built-in base role. `owner` has full access. `admin` can manage users and custom roles. `member` is governed by assigned custom roles. |
| `roleIds`     | `string[]`            | ✅       | IDs of custom roles assigned to this user in this org (from `organizations/{orgId}/roles/`). Empty array if none. |
| `joinedAt`    | `Timestamp`           | ✅       | When user joined (or re-joined) this organization                                            |
| `lastActiveAt`| `Timestamp \| null`   | ✅       | Last time user accessed any resource in this org; cached (update max once/5min)              |
| `deletedAt`   | `Timestamp \| null`   | ✅       | Soft-delete timestamp; `null` if active; set when user is removed from org                   |
| `createdAt`   | `Timestamp`           | ✅       | Server-set on document creation                                                              |
| `updatedAt`   | `Timestamp`           | ✅       | Server-set on every write                                                                    |

**Indexes**:
- `(orgId ASC, deletedAt ASC, joinedAt DESC)` — for listing active members sorted by join date
- `(orgId ASC, baseRole ASC, deletedAt ASC)` — for filtering by built-in role
- `(userId ASC, deletedAt ASC)` — for finding user's active memberships across orgs (`collectionGroup` query)

**Notes**:
- Membership records are soft-deleted but never hard-deleted (for recovery and audit purposes).
- The presence of a membership record in Firestore with `deletedAt != null` indicates the user was removed but data is in grace period.
- To reactivate a removed user, `deletedAt` is set back to `null` and associated deletion task is cancelled.
- `roleIds` is an array of custom role IDs. For permission evaluation, the server resolves each to its full `permissions[]` set at request time (server-side only, cached in middleware).

### `/organizations/{orgId}/roles/{roleId}` _(New — RBAC)_

Custom roles defined per organization. Orgs start with built-in system roles (`owner`, `admin`, `member`) that cannot be deleted. Admins can create additional custom roles.

| Field         | Type       | Required | Notes                                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | `string`   | ✅       | Firestore auto-generated or slug (e.g., `store-editor`)                    |
| `orgId`       | `string`   | ✅       | Owning organization                                                         |
| `name`        | `string`   | ✅       | Human-readable name (e.g., "Store Editor")                                 |
| `description` | `string \| null` | ✅  | Optional description                                                        |
| `isSystem`    | `boolean`  | ✅       | `true` for built-in roles (`owner`, `admin`, `member`); non-deletable       |
| `permissions` | `string[]` | ✅       | List of permission strings (e.g., `["store:read", "store:write", "files:read"]`) |
| `createdBy`   | `string`   | ✅       | Firebase Auth UID of admin who created the role                             |
| `createdAt`   | `Timestamp`| ✅       | Server-set                                                                  |
| `updatedAt`   | `Timestamp`| ✅       | Server-set on every write                                                   |

**Built-in system roles (seeded per org on creation)**:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| `owner` | `*` (all permissions; cannot be restricted) |
| `admin` | `users:manage`, `api-keys:manage`, `audit:read`, `store:*`, `memory:*`, `context:*`, `files:*` |
| `member` | `store:read`, `memory:read`, `context:read`, `files:read` |

**Available permissions**:
```
auth:read
memory:read  memory:write  memory:delete  memory:manage
store:read   store:write   store:delete   store:manage
context:read context:write context:delete context:manage
files:read   files:write   files:delete   files:manage
users:read   users:manage
api-keys:read api-keys:manage
billing:read  billing:manage
audit:read
```

**Indexes**:
- `(orgId ASC, isSystem ASC)` — for listing system vs custom roles

**Notes**:
- Permission strings ending in `:manage` imply all sub-actions (e.g., `store:manage` → `store:read` + `store:write` + `store:delete`).
- The wildcard `*` is only valid for the built-in `owner` role and is not stored literally; evaluated server-side.
- Roles are evaluated server-side by the API middleware; Firestore security rules enforce read/write access to collections but not fine-grained resource-level policies.

### `/organizations/{orgId}/policies/{policyId}` _(New — ABAC)_

Attribute-based access control policies. Conditionally grant or deny permissions based on resource and user attributes. Evaluated **after** RBAC role checks; explicit `deny` overrides any role-granted permission.

| Field         | Type                         | Required | Notes                                                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`          | `string`                     | ✅       | Firestore auto-generated document ID                                           |

| `name`        | `string`                     | ✅       | Human-readable policy name (e.g., "Staging stores write-only for QA team")    |
| `description` | `string \| null`             | ✅       | Optional description                                                           |
| `effect`      | `"allow" \| "deny"`          | ✅       | Whether this policy grants or denies the permission                            |
| `permissions` | `string[]`                   | ✅       | Permissions this policy affects (e.g., `["store:write", "store:delete"]`)     |
| `subjects`    | `PolicySubject[]`            | ✅       | Who this policy applies to (users, roles, or all members)                     |
| `conditions`  | `PolicyCondition[]`          | ✅       | Attribute conditions that must ALL match for policy to apply                   |
| `isActive`    | `boolean`                    | ✅       | Whether policy is actively evaluated (admins can disable without deleting)     |
| `createdBy`   | `string`                     | ✅       | Firebase Auth UID of admin who created the policy                              |
| `createdAt`   | `Timestamp`                  | ✅       | Server-set                                                                     |
| `updatedAt`   | `Timestamp`                  | ✅       | Server-set on every write                                                      |

**Type: PolicySubject**:
```typescript
type PolicySubject =
  | { type: "user"; userId: string }       // specific user
  | { type: "role"; roleId: string }       // all users with this custom role
  | { type: "baseRole"; baseRole: "admin" | "member" } // all users with built-in role
  | { type: "all" };                       // every org member
```

**Type: PolicyCondition** — resource/environment attribute that must match:
```typescript
interface PolicyCondition {
  attribute: string;   // e.g. "resource.tag.environment", "resource.createdBy", "request.ipCidr"
  operator: "eq" | "neq" | "in" | "notIn" | "startsWith" | "exists";
  value: string | string[] | boolean;
}
```

**Example policy** — deny store deletion for non-owners in production:
```json
{
  "name": "Protect production stores",
  "effect": "deny",
  "permissions": ["store:delete"],
  "subjects": [{ "type": "baseRole", "baseRole": "member" }],
  "conditions": [
    { "attribute": "resource.tag.environment", "operator": "eq", "value": "production" }
  ]
}
```

**Indexes**:
- `(orgId ASC, isActive ASC)` — for loading all active policies per org (cached in middleware)

**Notes**:
- Policies are evaluated server-side only; never enforced by Firestore security rules directly.
- All active policies for an org are loaded and cached in middleware (TTL: 60 s) to avoid per-request Firestore reads.
- Policy conditions operate on resource metadata (tags, ownerId, etc.) passed by each service handler at evaluation time.

### `/deletionTasks/{taskId}`

Top-level collection. Append-only. Tracks scheduled hard-deletion tasks for removed users.

| Field               | Type                               | Required | Notes                                                                     |

| `status`            | `TaskStatus` (enum)                | ✅       | One of: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`       |
| `retryCount`        | `number`                           | ✅       | Current retry attempt (0 on creation; incremented on each retry)           |
| `maxRetries`        | `number`                           | ✅       | Maximum retries allowed (default: 3)                                      |
| `error`             | `string \| null`                   | ✅       | Error message from last failed attempt; `null` if not failed yet            |
| `gracePeriodDays`   | `number`                           | ✅       | Grace period applied (e.g., 30 days); snapshot of org config at removal    |
| `recoveryDeadline`  | `Timestamp \| null`                | ✅       | Latest time user can be re-added to recover data; after this, recovery not possible |
| `completedAt`       | `Timestamp \| null`                | ✅       | Timestamp when hard deletion completed; null until done                    |
| `deletedEntityCount` | `{ stores?: number; apiKeys?: number; documents?: number; files?: number; }` | ✅ | Count of entities hard-deleted in Firestore & Cloud Storage |
| `createdAt`         | `Timestamp`                        | ✅       | Server-set when task created                                               |
| `updatedAt`         | `Timestamp`                        | ✅       | Server-set on every update (e.g., retry, completion)                       |

**Indexes**:
- `(orgId ASC, status ASC, scheduledDeleteAt ASC)` — for daily job to find tasks ready for deletion
- `(status ASC, scheduledDeleteAt ASC)` — for cross-org deletion job queries
- `(userId ASC, orgId ASC)` — for finding all deletion tasks for a user

**Enum: TaskStatus**:
```typescript
type TaskStatus = 
  | "pending"      // created, waiting for next job run
  | "in_progress"  // job is actively deleting
  | "completed"    // all data hard-deleted successfully
  | "failed"       // hard deletion failed after all retries
  | "cancelled";   // user was re-added before grace period expired
```

**Notes**:
- Deletion tasks are immutable append-only records. Updates to `status`, `retryCount`, `error`, `completedAt` are allowed but the task itself is never deleted.
- `recoveryDeadline` is set to `scheduledDeleteAt` but can be customized per org policy.
- On successful re-add within grace period, a new deletion task is created with status `cancelled` (old task NOT updated; immutable history is preserved).

  | "memory"    // Memory service
  | "store"     // Store service
  | "context"   // Context service
  | "dashboard" // Dashboard/UI layer
  | "system";   // Internal platform/Cloud Functions
```

**Indexes**:
- `(timestamp DESC)` — chronological system-wide log
- `(orgId ASC, timestamp DESC)` — all system events for a specific org
- `(eventType ASC, timestamp DESC)` — filter by event type across all orgs
- `(service ASC, timestamp DESC)` — filter by platform service
- `(orgId ASC, eventType ASC, timestamp DESC)` — org + event type compound filter

**Notes**:
- Written exclusively by Cloud Functions API middleware on every inbound API request and significant lifecycle event.
- Never readable by org admins or members — only platform super-admins via internal tooling.
- Immutable; never deleted. Archive to BigQuery or cold storage for long-term analytics.
- `requestId` enables tracing from system audit → Cloud Functions logs → OpenTelemetry spans.

- `(orgId ASC, affectedUserId ASC, timestamp DESC)` — for querying all events affecting a specific user
- `(orgId ASC, actorId ASC, timestamp DESC)` — for querying all actions by a specific actor

**Notes**:
- Audit log entries are immutable and must never be deleted. Archive to cold storage after 1+ years if needed.
- `oldValues` and `newValues` store snapshots of affected attributes (e.g., `{ role: "member" }` and `{ role: "admin" }` for promotions).
- `ipAddress` and `userAgent` are optional context fields useful for security investigation but not required for v1.
- For API-level events (auth, rate limiting), see system-level `/audits` collection instead.

### `/profiles/{userId}` _(Modified from existing 001-auth-onboarding-platform)_

Existing collection. Modified to support multi-organization functionality.

| Field                   | Type                | Required | Notes                                                        |

**Change from 001**: `orgId` is now the **primary** org only (for initial dashboard landing). Additional org memberships are tracked in `organizations/{orgId}/memberships/{userId}`.

---

### `/organizations/{orgId}` _(Modified from existing 001-auth-onboarding-platform)_

Existing collection. Modified to track membership count and admin count.

| Field          | Type             | Required | Notes                                                  |

| `memberCount`  | `number`         | ✅       | Denormalized count of active (non-deleted) members     |
| `adminCount`   | `number`         | ✅       | Denormalized count of active admins (for removal validation) |
| `gracePeriodDays` | `number`      | ✅       | Configurable grace period for hard deletion (default: 30) |
| `notificationsEnabled` | `boolean` | ✅    | Whether to send offboarding/role change notifications  |
| `createdAt`    | `Timestamp`      | ✅       | Server-set                                              |
| `updatedAt`    | `Timestamp`      | ✅       | Server-set on every write                              |

**Notes**:
- `memberCount` and `adminCount` are denormalized for efficient KPI queries. They are updated on every membership change (add, remove, role change, restore).
- `gracePeriodDays` is set per-org via organization settings (configurable 1-365 days; default: 30). This setting applies to ALL user removals in that org. Individual removals cannot override this setting. The value is captured as a snapshot in each deletion task for auditability.
- These are new fields added to the existing `organizations` collection from `001-auth-onboarding-platform`.

## Database Denormalization Strategy

To support efficient queries and UI rendering, the following fields are denormalized:

1. **User profile in org audits** (`actorEmail`, `affectedEmail`): Allows audit log display without secondary user lookups.
2. **Org/API key info in system audits** (`orgId`, `actorEmail`, `actorApiKeyId`): Allows system audit display without cross-collection joins.
3. **Membership counts in organization** (`memberCount`, `adminCount`): Enables off-the-shelf KPI tiles without aggregation queries (slow in Firestore).
4. **`baseRole` in membership**: Allows fast built-in permission checks without a role collection lookup.
5. **`roleIds` in membership**: Inline array avoids a separate `userRoles` join collection; works well for ≤ 20 roles per user.
6. **`orgId` in membership**: Enables collectionGroup queries to find all orgs a user belongs to.
7. **Entity counts in deletion task** (`deletedEntityCount`): Provides audit trail of what was deleted without secondary queries.
8. **Active policy cache in middleware**: All `isActive = true` policies for an org are loaded once per org per request (60 s TTL) to avoid per-permission Firestore reads.

**Denormalization Maintenance**:
- Updates to denormalized fields happen transactionally or via Cloud Functions to ensure consistency.
- Example: When a user is promoted to admin, both `organizations/{orgId}/memberships/{userId}.role` and `organizations/{orgId}.adminCount` are updated atomically in a transaction.

---

## Migration Notes (from 001 to 006)

The existing `organizations/{orgId}` and `profiles/{userId}` collections are extended, not replaced:

1. **Add new fields to `profiles/{userId}`**: No changes needed; `orgId` already exists and is now called the "primary" org.
2. **Add new subcollection**: Create `organizations/{orgId}/memberships/{userId}` as a new subcollection for all org-user relationships.
3. **Backfill memberships**: Existing org creator → admin membership relationship must be backfilled into the membership subcollection.
4. **Add new top-level collection**: Create `audits/` collection for system-level events (including auth events with no orgId).
5. **Add new top-level collection**: Create `deletionTasks/` collection.
6. **Add new subcollection**: Create `organizations/{orgId}/roles/` and seed with system roles (`owner`, `admin`, `member`) for each org.
7. **Add new subcollection**: Create `organizations/{orgId}/policies/` (empty initially).
8. **Add new subcollection**: Create `organizations/{orgId}/audits/` for org-scoped events.
9. **Backfill memberships**: Migrate existing memberships; set `baseRole` from previous `role` field; set `roleIds: []`.
10. **Update organization schema**: Add `memberCount`, `adminCount`, `gracePeriodDays`, `notificationsEnabled` fields.
7. **Firestore security rules**: Update to include new collections and subcollections (see pseudocode above).

## Indexes Required

```firestore
# Collection: audits (system-level)
- Index: (timestamp DESC)
- Index: (orgId ASC, timestamp DESC)
- Index: (eventType ASC, timestamp DESC)
- Index: (service ASC, timestamp DESC)
- Index: (orgId ASC, eventType ASC, timestamp DESC)

# Collection: organizations/{orgId}/memberships
- Index: (orgId ASC, deletedAt ASC, joinedAt DESC)
- Index: (orgId ASC, role ASC, deletedAt ASC)
- Scoped: collectionGroup index on (userId ASC, deletedAt ASC)

# Collection: deletionTasks
- Index: (status ASC, scheduledDeleteAt ASC)
- Index: (orgId ASC, status ASC, scheduledDeleteAt ASC)
- Index: (userId ASC, orgId ASC)

# Collection: organizations/{orgId}/roles (RBAC)
- Index: (orgId ASC, isSystem ASC)

# Collection: organizations/{orgId}/policies (ABAC)
- Index: (orgId ASC, isActive ASC)

# Collection: organizations/{orgId}/audits (org-scoped)
- Index: (orgId ASC, timestamp DESC)
- Index: (orgId ASC, eventType ASC, timestamp DESC)
- Index: (orgId ASC, affectedUserId ASC, timestamp DESC)
- Index: (orgId ASC, actorId ASC, timestamp DESC)
```

## Storage Paths

**Cloud Storage (for removal cleanup)**:
- User-uploaded files: `orgs/{orgId}/stores/{storeId}/documents/{docId}/{filename}`
- All files under `orgs/{orgId}/` owned by removed users are deleted via `buckets/list()` + `delete()` operations in the deletion task handler.

## Performance Considerations

- **User List Query**: Firestore query on `organizations/{orgId}/memberships` with filters and pagination. Expected latency: < 500 ms for orgs with 10k members (with proper compound indexes).
- **System Audit Query**: Firestore query on `/audits` with `orgId` or `eventType` compound indexes. Expected latency: < 1 s. High write volume (every API request) — consider batching writes or routing to BigQuery for analytics.
- **Org Audit Query**: Firestore query on `organizations/{orgId}/audits` with compound indexes. Expected latency: < 1 s for years of data with range filters.
- **Deletion Task Polling**: Scheduled Cloud Function queries `deletionTasks` for tasks where `status = "pending"` and `scheduledDeleteAt <= now()`. Should handle 100+ tasks per run.
- **Session Invalidation**: Upon user removal from any organization, **all global sessions for that user** are invalidated (across all orgs and devices). Broadcast token revocation via session store. Session refresh checks revocation list (in-memory cache with TTL or Redis). User must re-authenticate everywhere. Expected overhead: < 100 ms per authenticated request.
